# DAILY
- Daily is a desktop application that stores your daily diaries, its magical UI/UX could make you write your personnel diaries every day without skiping.
- you can also create an account to store the data on the server or if you are not trusting us you can use it localy and store data in you computer.
- if you choose that last choice you will lose your data in case of somethings hapening to your computer.
- this is not a commertiel app, I will built it to use it in the first place
